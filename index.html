            <h1>Style</h1>
            <p>The overarching music genre of Arctic Monkeys is rock or indie rock. They experimented with garage rock, punk rock, and more. They are also known to have explored the genres of post-punk and post-Britpop.

                Arctic Monkeys are extremely popular not only in their home country Britain but all over the world.
                
                Members have stated various influences on their music, such as Oasis, Eminem, Nick Cave, and more.
                
                Their intricate lyricism is a crucial part of their success as well. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Arctic Monkeys have risen to success in late 2004/early 2005 when their demo songs that had been handed out at gigs found their way onto the internet.
                
                In the meantime, the band has released six studio albums, with various genres throughout.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Arctic Monkeys started back in 2002, as an instrumental only group. Alex and Matt, who were close friends and neighbours at the time, teamed up with their pal Andy to form the group. After the addition of Jamie, the Arctic Monkeys played their first official gig in 2003 and soon began recording demo tracks.
            </p>
            <br>          
            <p> The Arctic Monkeys began to gain popularity as they handed out CDs, containing their 18 demo tracks, at various gigs. The group also gained quite the following on the social media platform MySpace, and are now described as one of the first bands to come to the public's attention through the Internet.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The band's large following on MySpace aided them in the promotion of their debut EP 'Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys', which was released in 2005. Following on from this - when performing on the Carling Stage, reserved for unsigned/less known bands, at both Reading and Leeds Festivals, the gang attracted an unusually large crowd. In their early days, Arctic Monkeys would attend, and often play support, at fellow Sheffield band Milburn's gigs. Many fans have since drawn comparisons between the two bands' music, claiming there is a striking similarity between their chords and lyrics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite recording multiple demo tracks from the moment they formed back in 2002, the Arctic Monkeys first official single was the iconic "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor". The debut track was released in October 2005, and flew straight to the Number 1 spot on the UK Singles Chart. The track, which featured on their 2006 debut album "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not", was ranked Number 7 on NME's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and was nominated for multiple awards.

            <h1>Legacy</h1>
            <p>
                According to Vice, "in Britain at least, Arctic Monkeys have reached a point where they are too enormous, too beloved a force to truly fail" and are probably the UK's biggest, most culturally important band. Vice further states that they are "the band that your friends whose music taste can otherwise be described as "Match of the Day-wave" are desperate to see perform live; the band dads and little brothers have in common—simply because throughout their career, they have remained consistent, while their peers in both sound and age have failed to keep similar longevity." English poet John Cooper Clarke praised the band as "the nearest thing" to the Beatles. Radio X has also named Arctic Monkeys as one of the best bands of all time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Following the success of Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, some critics cited the Arctic Monkeys as revolutionising the way people find music as they built a fanbase on the basis of a few demos shared by fans through the internet. Critics hugely praised the album for its depiction of youth British culture and for resurging British indie music that had waned after the 1990s, with NME declaring the Arctic Monkeys "Our Generation's Most Important Band."
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>According to NME, the band's 2013 album AM "became the soundtrack for countless nights out, hook-ups and comedowns in every town and city of this country" by the end of the 2010s. Johnny Davis of Esquire wrote, "Every so often, a band emerges to define the times not just for a generation of music fans but for a whole era the Clash, the Smiths, Oasis, the Strokes. Where Arctic Monkeys may be unique is that they have now managed that role twice [with both Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not and AM]" The co-founder of the band's label Domino Records, Laurence Bell, said "They're the toast of the playground again, every 13-year-old loves them. But so do grandads who were into Led Zeppelin. It's very rare for a band to come out of the traps so big [with Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not] and then have another massive moment [with AM]. It reminds me of The Who and The Stones, where they did some pop singles early on and then moved into an imperial phase." Other musicians have praised the band including Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, and rapper RZA. Bob Dylan claims to have made "special efforts" to see the band live, while David Bowie, said they were "a nice solid Brit band." Damon Albarn called them "the last great guitar band [...] I don't really know if there's anything as good as that since."

                The band have influenced several artists such as Black Midi, Blossoms, Fontaines D.C., Wallows, The 1975, Halsey, Yungblud,Lewis Capaldi, Louis Tomlinson, Mahalia, Arlo Parks, Sam Fender, Billie Eilish, Bring Me the Horizon, Måneskin, Hozier, Slowthai, JID and Earthgang, among others.
